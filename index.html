							<h1 class="major">California Housing & </h1>
							<h1 class="major"> FastFood Data Analysis </h1>
							<h2>Project Purpose:</h2>
							<p>My team and I wanted to observe if there is a correlation between the amount of fast food restaurants and housing prices within California. </p>
							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Data analysis, coding</li>
								<li>Presenter</li>
								<li>Documentation as well as Proofreading and editing of paragraphs</li>
								<li>Edited presentation video</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Applications</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Jupyter Notebook </li> <!--(used to grab, examine and filter data)-->
								<li>GitHub </li> <!--(used to share and transfer files between groupmates)-->
								<li>Google Docs </li> <!--(used to plan out the project and write down what we've analyzed as a group)-->
								<li>Adobe Premiere Pro </li> <!--(used to edit a presentation video explaining our findings)-->
							</ul>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Fast food restaurants are very important for people looking to quickly deal with their hunger as well as find convenient and inexpensive food. Fast food restaurants gain more popularity with the number of people and students rising. Within this project we are interested in understanding if fast food restaurants build their restaurants in places of lower socio-economic status to get to an advantageous point in the location for more profit. Since many fast food restaurants appeal to low income people, we were interested in finding a connection in the location of the establishment and the income of the houses values. </p>

							<p>College students may look to eat fast food more often as most of their time may be taken up by studying and spending time with other students around a campus centered location. Fast food restaurants and lower income communities are connected by convenience and budget. A lower budget may be an easy reason for a person who is hungry for quick fulfilling food. Fast food is also good for students looking to bring back food to their home and saving time going out of their house. Urban areas may have a good connection with fast foods because tourist attractions may pull in tourists and large populations of people. </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P1-1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Dataset 2</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P1-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Setup</h2>
							<p>To setup our analysis, we used Python and importaed packages through jyupter notebook that would allow us to filter, examine and collect data.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P1-3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Group Findings and Process</h2>
							<p>After finding out which datasets we wanted to work with, we proceeded to clean the data to our liking so it would be easier to work with. The steps we took to clean the data are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Imported the data files and read them in using Pandas.
								</li>
								<li>Examined the shape of the dataset.
								</li>
								<li>Checked to see if the dataset contained NAN values.
								</li>
								<li>Dropped the categories, country, and unamed: 0 columns since the data in these columns isn't relevant to what we are analyzing.
								</li>
								<li>Filtered the dataset by province to show what is relevant for CA.
								</li>
								<li>Lowercase all the strings in each columns to make it easier to code. For example: (city, address, name, province, website, and the names of the columns)
								</li>
								<li>Reset the index.
								</li>
								<li>Stripped each column to remove any white spaces.
								</li>
								<li>Changed postal code into all integer variables.
								</li>
								<li>Lastly, we viewed our dataset to make sure it is cleaned how we expect.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P1-4-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the image below we decided to plot the house value against the income value to see the distribution of values.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P1-5.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the image below we decided to plot the concentration of restaurants around California with the concentration of houses to see the relevance between both.</p>

							<h1 class="major">WEDO Joint Project</h1>
							<h2>Project Purpose:</h2>
							<p>Create a pitch deck and brochure that would include information given to me by my teammates in order to convey information about the organization to other platforms.</p>
							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p>In this project I my assigned role was to be the Creative Director, I would oversee all designs and decisions made throughout this project.
								Additionally, I had also worked on documentation as well as project reports every week.</p>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p>WEDO currently lacks volunteers, partners and student ambassadors and we want to bring more attention to the organization to help incrase the workforce.</p>
							<p><b><center>What is a good way for an organization to present information to multiple groups in a similar fashion?</center></b></p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>The Women's Entrepreneurship Day Organization asked our group for help in obtaining more attention towards their organization. To help spread information across multiple platforms, we decided to create a pitch deck and brochure. This pitch deck and brochure will help representatives give off information about the organization across multiple platforms. With a base pitch deck and brochure, the organization will be able to expand and come across multiple people who may be interested in joining the organization. </p>

							<p>A pitch deck and brochure combo allows us to create a format for ambassadors to follow and relay wanted information to potential groups of people looking to join the organization. In order to find further accessibility to the pitch deck, we designed a brochure to accompany it. Through this, the visuals can be found virtually and physically. </p>
							<h2>Brainstorming Process</h2>
							<p>My groupmates and I decided to use this Theory of Change Diagram to convey our ideas in a way that would display four main points. The input, output, outcome and impact are shown to reflect our goals.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P2-1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Roadmap and Stakeholders</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P2-2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>WEDO Color Palette</h2>
							<p>This is the original colors used by WEDO and their color palette that they suggested we use within our pitch deck and brochure.</p>
							<p>I decided to avoid these colors because at a first glance, it was quite harsh to the eyes.</p>
							<p>The two shades of violet I converted the colors to seemed like a more welcoming theme of colors.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P2-3.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>WEDO Pitch Deck Final Product</h2>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P2-4-2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>User Feedback Responses</h2>
							<p>Our test procedures were to present the pitch deck and brochure to our users and then we asked them the questions on our feedback form. The form included questions about name, participant kind/demographic/location, usability rating and why, desirability rating and why and feasibility/sustainability rating and why. The specific questions include how usable do you think our pitch deck and brochure combo is for attracting "investors" or ambassadors/volunteers, how desirable do you think our pitch deck and brochure combo in terms of how it is functionally designed, how aesthetically pleasing it is, and how feasible/sustainable is our pitch deck and brochure combo for future use in the WEDO organization.</p>

						<article id="project3">
							<h1 class="major">Youtube Re-design</h1>
							<h2>Project Purpose:</h2>
							<p>Used Figma to prototype a YouTube mobile redesign that would address the algorithmic and addictive aspects of youtube, providing an improved user-experience and the ability to better manage their time. </p>
							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p>UI designer and UX researcher</p>
							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p>We want to address the algorithmic and addictive issues of youtube to give viewers a better expeirence along with improving their mental well-being.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>We aim to improve the user experience on YouTube so users will have more control over how they use the platform what content they see.</p>
							<p>We used figma to impliment 3 of our own features into the mobile youtube platform.</p>
							<h2>Targeted Users</h2>
							<h3>Example 1:</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P3-1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Example 2:</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P3-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Lo-Fi Prototype</h2>
							<p>Feature 1: The modular homepage feature allowss users more control of the content displayed on the their homepage. Users can change the content layout and allows them to add sections of their choice to the homepage. By giving them the ability to change the layout of the homepage it allows for more visibility of content that would normally be difficult to find like community post and livestreams.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P3-5.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Feature 2: In order to reduce the amount of time wasted watching videos that are either wrong or outdated we introduced a usefulness rating system similar to the like/dislike system but without the negative connotations of the dislike button. This will help people determine whether a video is worth their time and if the information provided in a video is accurate. If a how-to or teaching video is incorrect it could negatively affect users but with a usefulness rating users can let others know that the video gives bad information.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/P3-6.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Feature 3: To help users better manage their time spent watching YouTube we created a feature that allows users to view their time watched and set limits to the amount of time and videos they watch, also allowing them to set alarms for them to stop using YouTube so they don’t end up spending more time than they would prefer watching videos.</p>
